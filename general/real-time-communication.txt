4 real-time communication patterns you should know as a software engineer (not kidding):


1 Short Polling

• The client periodically requests the server for an update.
• The server returns an empty response if nothing has changed.


2 Long Polling

• The server holds the client request until there's an update.
• The server responds to a client only when there's an update.
• The server returns an empty response on timeout.


3 Server-Sent Events

• The server keeps an open connection with the client.
• The server pushes updates to the client, but communication is unidirectional.


4 Websockets

• The server keeps an open TCP connection with the client.
